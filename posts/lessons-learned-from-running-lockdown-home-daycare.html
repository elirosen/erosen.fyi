              <p> Like most people with kids, as soon as I heard that we'd be sheltering in place for more than two weeks, my first thought was about my kids." Not in the sense of "I hope my kids are ok" but more like "OMG, I am going to die if I'm stuck at home for two weeks with my kids."</p>
                <p>
                  My kids are cute and sweet, but there is a reason I pay someone else to watch them all day. It's a very hard job.

                And as I was talking to other parents I noticed that many (all?) of them shared that same sense of dread. Nobody was talking about their concern for their kids, or even their fears of getting the virus, but everyone was very concerned with their own mental health. 
I started to think about about why we were all so anxious about being stuck at home and having to work. What was it that I was so nervous about, and more importantly, how could I solve that problem so my wife and I could stay sane and productive? 
The False-Choice  of Work Life Balance
For me the challenge comes down to the fact that our generation talks a lot about "work life balance" but this is the first time we've ever felt the whole see-saw just break in half. 
I am of the belief that today there is really no such thing as work-life balance. I think it gets spoken about as if there is some sort of magic equilibrium where work and life are perfectly in balance with one another. But we know that is just not true. And that's what I mean when I say there is no such thing as balance - there will never be this wonderful prolonged period where work and life fit neatly together. And I dont necessarily think that's a bad thing. 
Today work and life are more like a see-saw. They ebb and flow together, one is weighing you down and the other can lighten up. I work in tech, but I don't think this is strictly a tech thing¹: people can get flexible scheudles, people catch up on work at home at night, if there is an important deliverable you work over the weekend, and if something comes up with the kids you can skip out of work and take care of it. 
  obviously people that work in fields like healthcare that require you to be onsite, this is not the applicable.
In some sense the balance is actually in the fact that at the end of the day/month/year things seem to balance out. At any given point one is taking precedence over the other. 
And that's the key, when one is up, the other is down. 
When we realized that we'd have to work full time AND take care of our kids full-time, the see-saw snapped in half.

Taking care of kids is a full-time, stressful, all-consuming job, and getting paid a salary takes an entire day as well.
